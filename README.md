# Web-Design-Challenge
We'll be creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a past assignment. Specifically, we'll be plotting [weather data](Resources/cities.csv).  In building this dashboard, we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them.
